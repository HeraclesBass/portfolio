## Summary

Full-stack software engineer who came up through 10 years of telecom design and team leadership, building internal automation tools before independently architecting a production microservices platform (31 projects, 70+ containers). 1,600+ verified hours of AI-augmented development across 2,000 sessions, driven by a need to solve problems and ship. Looking to bring that momentum and builder mindset to a team where I can keep learning and contribute from day one.

## Experience

### Full-Stack Software Engineer — *Hercules Platform (Independent)*
**2024 – Present** | Chicago, IL

- **Platform architecture:** Designed and deployed large-scale Docker container orchestration across dozens of services with Redis pub/sub, WebSocket, and event-driven inter-service communication.
- **Authentication and access:** Multi-tenant applications with SSO, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control with isolated data per user group.
- **Deployment and reliability:** Automated pipelines with health checks, rollback, and zero-downtime deployment through Docker Compose orchestration.
- **Observability:** Full observability stack — dashboards, log aggregation, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and automated alerting across all services.
- **Agent orchestration:** Spec-driven framework with task-based routing, file ownership enforcement, and parallel team execution across multi-service projects.

### Team Lead & Internal Tools Developer — *Precision Valley Communications (Dycom Industries)*
**2015 – Present** | Remote

- **Team leadership:** Led 4 CAD designers, assigned project boundaries, performed expert-level Bentley MicroStation design, QC'd output. 500+ PON designs over 2 years.
- **Splice matrix generator:** Google Apps Script tool that auto-generates fiber splice assignments from design data. Used on all 500+ designs, reducing 2-3 hours of manual work to minutes each. Estimated 1,000+ hours saved over 2 years.
- **Automation suite:** QC tools that eliminated an entire manual review step, design calculators for cable counts and distances, and reporting automations. Saved the team 10-20 hours/week collectively. In production for 2+ years.
- **WiFi workflow organizer:** React web application centralizing site survey data collection, BOM equipment selection, and standardized output formatting into a single workflow. Replaced scattered spreadsheets and inconsistent documentation.
